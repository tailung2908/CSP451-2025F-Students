# Week 1: Introduction to GitHub and Version Control

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamental concepts of version control systems
- Master basic Git commands and workflows
- Create and manage GitHub repositories effectively
- Write professional documentation using Markdown

## Key Concepts

### Version Control Benefits

1. **Change Tracking**: Every modification is recorded with who, what, when, and why
2. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work simultaneously without conflicts
3. **Backup & Recovery**: Complete history allows reverting to any previous state
4. **Branching**: Experiment with new features without affecting main code

## Essential Git Commands

```bash
# Initialize repository
git init

# Stage changes
git add filename.txt
git add .  # Add all changes

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Descriptive message about changes"

# Connect to remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

# Push changes
git push origin main

# Clone existing repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

## Markdown Essentials

# Heading 1
